# launch hybris

Most simple hybris launcher using Assembler or C

## Why the ...?

Take it as "educational software".
Take it as "demo software".
Take it as "drunken developer software".
Take it as a joke.
You mileage may vary.

## What does it?

It shows a most simple way to start SAP hybris.
Two versions are provided: A C version and a Assembler version.
(Hey! Didn't you ever dream about starting a very big Java application like Hybris with a small launcher written in Assembler code?)

## How does it work?

It sets JAVA_HOME and then starts Hybris in a screen session.
